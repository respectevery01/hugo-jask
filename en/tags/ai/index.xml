      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;tldr&#34;&gt;TL;DR&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, many company develop their own AI-Model. But they all vary in quality, and I collected answers from different AI models on the same topic.

Now ai era, the hottest is big data + AI and blockchain + AI, the market has appeared a lot of use cases, but when we all know that there is a focus in the line of sight, then there is a blind spot, people are concerned about the artificial intelligence, then, there are those non-artificial intelligence industry is in the next five years is promising?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
