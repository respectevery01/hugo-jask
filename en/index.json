[{"content":"TL;DR For now, many company develop their own AI-Model. But they all vary in quality, and I collected answers from different AI models on the same topic. I can\u0026rsquo;t determine which model is more accurate. Topic is \u0026ldquo;Study which burns more calories, running three kilometers fast (average pace 5 min 45 sec/KM) or jogging three kilometers (average pace 7 min/KM)? Now ai era, the hottest is big data + AI and blockchain + AI, the market has appeared a lot of use cases, but when we all know that there is a focus in the line of sight, then there is a blind spot, people are concerned about the artificial intelligence, then, there are those non-artificial intelligence industry is in the next five years is promising?\u0026rdquo;\nChatGPT-4o 1. Calorie Burn: Running vs. Jogging Running faster burns more calories than jogging the same distance, even though both activities cover 3 kilometers. Here\u0026rsquo;s why:\nRunning (5:45 min/km): At a faster pace, you push your body harder, causing a higher heart rate and greater energy expenditure. Running at 5:45 min/km typically burns about 100-150 calories per kilometer, depending on factors like weight and fitness level. Jogging (7:00 min/km): Jogging is less intense, so while you still burn calories, it tends to be around 80-100 calories per kilometer. Though the difference in time is small, the higher intensity of running means a faster calorie burn overall. On average, running 3 kilometers fast burns more calories than jogging the same distance.\n2. Non-AI Industries with Promising Futures Despite the focus on AI, some non-AI industries are showing promise over the next five years:\nRenewable Energy: As the world shifts toward sustainable solutions, solar, wind, and hydropower are set to expand. Innovations in energy storage, efficiency, and grid management will play a critical role in meeting climate goals. Healthcare \u0026amp; Biotechnology: With advances in personalized medicine, genomics, and new treatments, the healthcare industry will continue growing, particularly in areas like gene editing (e.g., CRISPR) and wearable health tech. Sustainable Agriculture \u0026amp; Food Tech: As populations grow and climate change impacts food production, there is increasing demand for sustainable farming, vertical agriculture, plant-based proteins, and lab-grown meat. Circular Economy \u0026amp; Recycling Tech: Reducing waste and managing resources better are global priorities. Industries focusing on recycling, upcycling, and materials science will thrive, particularly as consumers demand greener products. Logistics \u0026amp; Supply Chain Innovation: Innovations in logistics—like drone deliveries, autonomous vehicles, and blockchain for transparent supply chains—are growing rapidly, especially post-pandemic. Blockchain is increasingly utilized to verify product origins and track global shipments. These industries may benefit from some AI integration, but their core growth is driven by factors beyond AI.\nAccording to the GPT, fast running burns more calories than jogging, and it points to a promising future for logistics and supply chains.\nClaude-3.5 Sonnet Let\u0026rsquo;s break this down into two parts:\nCalorie burn comparison: Running 3 km fast (5:45 min/km pace) will generally burn more calories than jogging 3 km at a slower pace (7:00 min/km). This is because:\nHigher intensity exercise typically burns more calories per minute The faster pace requires more effort and engages more muscle fibers The body works harder to maintain the quicker speed However, the exact calorie difference depends on factors like the individual\u0026rsquo;s weight, fitness level, and metabolism. On average, a 70 kg (154 lb) person might burn:\nAbout 270-300 calories running 3 km at the faster pace About 230-250 calories jogging 3 km at the slower pace Promising non-AI industries in the next five years: While AI and blockchain are indeed hot topics, several non-AI industries show promise:\na) Renewable Energy: With climate change concerns growing, solar, wind, and other clean energy technologies are likely to see significant growth.\nb) Biotechnology and Personalized Medicine: Advancements in gene therapy, personalized treatments, and drug discovery offer huge potential.\nc) Space Technology: Private space exploration, satellite internet, and space tourism are emerging fields with room for growth.\nd) Sustainable Agriculture: Vertical farming, precision agriculture, and plant-based proteins are addressing food security and environmental concerns.\ne) Mental Health Services: The growing awareness of mental health issues is driving demand for innovative treatment and support services.\nf) Cybersecurity: As digital threats evolve, the need for advanced security solutions continues to grow.\ng) Elderly Care and Age-Tech: With aging populations in many countries, services and technologies for older adults are becoming increasingly important.\nh) Circular Economy and Recycling: Industries focused on reducing waste and promoting sustainability are likely to see increased interest and investment.\nThese industries may not be as hyped as AI, but they address critical global challenges and have significant growth potential. Would you like me to elaborate on any of these areas?\nAccording to Claude\u0026rsquo;s conclusion, fast running burns more calories than jogging, but it points to areas not mentioned by the GPT: Elderly Care and Age-Tech, Mental Health Services and Space Technology\nPerplexity Pro To compare the calories burned while running and jogging three kilometers, we can analyze the two scenarios based on their respective paces.\nCalories Burned Comparison Running at 5 minutes 45 seconds per kilometer:\nCalories burned: Approximately 232 calories for a person weighing around 159 pounds (72 kg) over a distance of 3 km[1]. Jogging at 7 minutes per kilometer:\nCalories burned: Approximately 243 calories for the same weight over the same distance[2]. Summary of Findings Activity Pace (min/km) Calories Burned Running 5:45 232 Jogging 7:00 243 Conclusion Interestingly, jogging at a slower pace (7 min/km) results in slightly higher calorie expenditure compared to running faster (5:45 min/km). This could be attributed to the longer duration of the activity, as calorie burn is influenced by both intensity and time spent exercising.\nFuture Prospects Beyond AI In terms of industries that may show promise in the next five years outside of artificial intelligence, several sectors are gaining attention:\nRenewable Energy: As global awareness of climate change increases, investments in solar, wind, and other renewable energy sources are expected to grow significantly.\nHealthcare Technology: Innovations in telemedicine, wearable health devices, and personalized medicine are transforming healthcare delivery and patient management.\nCybersecurity: With the rise in digital transformations and data breaches, demand for robust cybersecurity solutions is increasing.\nSustainable Agriculture: Technologies aimed at improving food production efficiency while minimizing environmental impact are becoming crucial.\nBlockchain Applications: Beyond cryptocurrencies, blockchain technology is being explored for supply chain transparency, secure transactions, and digital identity verification.\nThese sectors highlight a shift towards sustainability and efficiency, indicating strong growth potential in the coming years.\nCitations: [1] https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?input=Calories+burned+running+3+kilometers+at+5+minutes+45+seconds+per+kilometer [2] https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?input=Calories+burned+jogging+3+kilometers+at+7+minutes+per+kilometer\nAccording to Perplexity, jogging burns more calories than fast running. This conclusion is different from the one reached by the two models above, and it also points to blockchain as a promising industry for the next five years\nKimi ai Chinese prompt VS Kimi ai English prompt Chinese prompt: 研究一下快跑三公里（平均配速5分45秒/KM）和慢跑三公里（平均配速7分钟/KM）哪个消耗的热量大？现在ai时代，最火热的就是大数据+AI和区块链+AI，市面上已经出现了很多用例，但是当我们都知道视线中有了焦点，那便有了盲点，人们都关注人工智能的话，还有那些非人工智能行业是在未来五年内是有前景的？\nEnglish prompt: Study which burns more calories, running three kilometers fast (average pace 5 min 45 sec/KM) or jogging three kilometers (average pace 7 min/KM)?

Chinese Edition: 快跑三公里和慢跑三公里的热量消耗比较 消耗的热量主要取决于跑步的强度、持续时间和个人体重。以下是两种跑步方式的热量消耗计算方法：\n快跑三公里（平均配速5分45秒/KM）：\n配速：5分45秒/KM，约等于10.43公里/小时。 持续时间：3公里 * 5.75分钟/公里 = 17.25分钟。 假设体重为70公斤，使用公式：卡路里（Cal）= 体重（kg）× 跑步距离（km）× 1.036。 计算：70kg × 3km × 1.036 ≈ 217.56卡路里。 慢跑三公里（平均配速7分钟/KM）：\n配速：7分钟/KM，约等于8.57公里/小时。 持续时间：3公里 * 7分钟/公里 = 21分钟。 假设体重为70公斤，使用相同公式。 计算：70kg × 3km × 1.036 ≈ 217.56卡路里。 从计算结果来看，无论是快跑还是慢跑三公里，消耗的热量大致相同。然而，快跑的强度更大，对心肺功能的提升效果更显著，而慢跑则更适合初学者和恢复性训练。\n未来五年内有前景的非人工智能行业 尽管人工智能领域备受关注，以下几个非人工智能行业在未来五年内也具有很大的发展潜力：\n教育：\n基本公共教育、职业技术教育、高等教育和教育改革等领域将持续受到关注和投资。 养老：\n社区居家养老、养老机构和适老化改造等服务需求将大幅增加。 婴幼儿照护：\n托育服务、儿童友好城市和科学育儿等领域有望快速发展。 文化旅游：\n文艺创作、文化遗产保护和旅游质量提升等方面具有较大的市场潜力。 体育：\n全民健身公共服务、体育消费和竞技体育等领域将迎来更多投资和发展机会。 医药卫生：\n医护人员培养、家庭医生、社会办医和中医药等领域将继续扩展。 制造业：\n高端新材料、重大技术装备、智能制造与机器人技术、航空发动机及燃气轮机等领域将保持强劲增长。 农业：\n农业综合生产和乡村建设等领域将得到更多政策支持和投资。 环保：\n生态安全、环境改善和绿色发展等领域将成为重点关注的方向。 这些行业不仅符合国家政策导向，还能满足社会发展的实际需求，具有广阔的市场前景和投资机会。 跑步卡路里计算器 - Calcopedia 跑步卡路里计算器 - Calcopedia 前瞻网 - 未来五年值得关注的行业 According to Kimi\u0026rsquo;s conclusions, fast running burns the same number of calories as jogging, which is vastly different from the previous model, and it points to a lot of abstraction, like picking from within a large industry category that is not targeted\n2. English Edition: 跑步与慢跑消耗的卡路里比较 根据研究，跑步和慢跑消耗的卡路里取决于速度和运动强度。跑步三公里（平均配速5分45秒/公里）比慢跑三公里（平均配速7分/公里）消耗更多的卡路里。具体数据如下：\n跑步三公里：\n速度较快，心率更高，消耗的卡路里更多。 一项研究表明，跑步1600米（约1英里）消耗的能量约为471.03千焦耳（约112.6千卡）。 慢跑三公里：\n速度较慢，心率较低，消耗的卡路里相对较少。 同样的研究表明，步行1600米消耗的能量约为372.54千焦耳（约89.1千卡）。 因此，跑步三公里消耗的卡路里比慢跑三公里更多。\n非人工智能行业的前景 在未来五年，除了人工智能外，还有许多非人工智能行业具有良好的发展前景。以下是一些值得关注的非人工智能行业：\n新能源：包括太阳能、风能和氢能等清洁能源，随着全球对环保和可持续发展的重视，新能源行业将持续增长。 生物技术：基因编辑、再生医学和生物制药等领域在医疗和农业方面有巨大潜力。 高端制造：包括航空航天、高铁、智能制造和机器人技术等，随着技术进步和产业升级，这些领域将迎来新的发展机遇。 教育和培训：随着社会对高质量教育的需求增加，在线教育和职业培训等领域将持续扩展。 养老和健康：随着人口老龄化，养老服务和健康管理行业将快速发展。 文化旅游：文化创意产业和旅游业在提升生活质量和促进经济发展方面具有重要作用。 这些行业在未来五年内有望获得显著增长，值得投资和关注。 Energy expenditure comparison between walking and running 工业和信息化部等七部门关于推动未来产业创新发展的实施意见 勾勒2035年远景！未来5年这些行业值得关注 未来5年生活什么新模样？——听行业“领军者”展望“十四五”新变化 It\u0026rsquo;s interesting to note that the English version\u0026rsquo;s conclusion is completely different from the previous Chinese version, which concluded that fast running burns more calories than jogging. But the industry it points out is hardly different from the previous one. This shows that the English version is a bit more accurate than the Chinese version.\nGemini 1.5 Pro VS Gamma 2 2B Both models are developed by Google, but only Gemini is open for user use\n1. Gemini 1.5 Pro Running at a faster pace (5 min 45 sec/KM) will burn more calories than jogging (7 min/KM) for the same distance of three kilometers. This is because higher intensity exercise requires more energy expenditure. While the total distance is the same, the faster pace means more work is done in a shorter time, leading to a higher calorie burn.\nRegarding your question about promising non-AI industries in the next five years, it\u0026rsquo;s important to remember that AI is becoming pervasive, influencing many sectors. However, several areas are likely to thrive independently or alongside AI:\nRenewable Energy: With growing climate concerns, the renewable energy sector, including solar, wind, geothermal, and hydrogen power, is poised for significant growth. Jobs in installation, maintenance, and research will be in demand. Healthcare (specifically non-AI driven aspects): While AI is transforming diagnostics and drug discovery, core healthcare professions like nursing, physical therapy, and elder care will remain crucial due to aging populations and the increasing demand for personalized care. Mental health services are also expected to see continued growth. Sustainable Agriculture and Food Production: As the global population grows, sustainable farming practices, food technology focused on reducing waste and improving yields, and alternative protein sources will become increasingly important. Skilled Trades: Plumbers, electricians, carpenters, and HVAC technicians will continue to be in high demand as infrastructure ages and requires maintenance and upgrades. These are areas where automation is more challenging. Personalized Education and Training: While AI can play a role in education, the need for human interaction and individualized learning experiences will remain strong. This includes areas like specialized tutoring, vocational training, and life coaching. Creative Industries: While AI can generate art and music, the uniquely human aspects of creativity, storytelling, and emotional expression will continue to be valued. This includes fields like writing, performing arts, visual arts, and design. Cybersecurity: As our reliance on technology increases, so does the risk of cyberattacks. Experts in cybersecurity will be essential for protecting individuals, businesses, and governments from these threats. While AI can assist, human expertise is paramount. Biotechnology (outside of AI-driven drug discovery): Fields like genetic counseling, biomanufacturing, and bioethics will see growth, driven by advancements in understanding and manipulating biological systems. It\u0026rsquo;s important to note that these are just a few examples, and the specific industries that thrive will depend on various factors, including technological advancements, economic conditions, and societal changes. Also, keep in mind that even in these \u0026ldquo;non-AI\u0026rdquo; industries, AI will likely play some role, even if it\u0026rsquo;s not the primary driver. The key is to look for areas where uniquely human skills and expertise remain essential.\nAccording to 1.5 Pro, fast running burns more calories than jogging, and it points to a completely different industry than the other models - Skilled Trades - which is interesting, and in layman\u0026rsquo;s terms means that blue-collar will be a high-paying profession in the future!\n2. Gamma 2 2B Let\u0026rsquo;s break down your questions:\nBurning Calories\nFast Running: Running at an average pace of 5:45/km for 3 km would burn significantly more calories than jogging. This is because fast running requires a higher intensity and your body works harder to maintain that speed. Jogging: Jogging at 7 min/km for 3 km will burn fewer calories than fast running. Why the Difference?\nIntensity: Fast running is much more intense than jogging. Your heart rate and breathing will be elevated, and your muscles will be working harder. Metabolic Rate: Your body burns more calories at a higher intensity. Important Note: The exact number of calories burned depends on factors like your weight, age, and fitness level.\nAI and Non-AI Industries in the Next 5 Years\nYou\u0026rsquo;re right, the hype around AI is immense, but it\u0026rsquo;s important to remember that AI is just one tool in the toolbox. Here are some industries that are likely to see significant growth in the next 5 years, regardless of AI:\nHealthcare: Telemedicine, personalized medicine, and preventative care will continue to grow. Manufacturing: Automation and robotics will continue to reshape the manufacturing landscape. Renewable Energy: Solar, wind, and other renewable energy sources will see continued investment and development. Agriculture: Precision agriculture, using data and AI, will improve efficiency and sustainability. Education: Online learning platforms and personalized learning experiences will become more prevalent. Financial Services: Fintech (financial technology) will continue to evolve, with AI playing a key role in areas like fraud detection and investment management. The Importance of Balance\nWhile AI is a powerful tool, it\u0026rsquo;s important to remember that it\u0026rsquo;s not a magic bullet. Many industries will continue to thrive because of human ingenuity, creativity, and the ability to adapt to change.\nLet me know if you\u0026rsquo;d like to explore any of these industries in more detail!\nAccording to Gamma\u0026rsquo;s conclusions, fast running burns more calories than jogging, and it points out that financial services are promising, unlike all the previous models\nAll in All Finally, even though I listed many of the AI models on the market, it\u0026rsquo;s still not all of them. They all have their own focus; Kimi\u0026rsquo;s English version is better than the Chinese version, but since it can only search websites within China, the accuracy is not as good as the other models. ChatGPT and Claude are both comparable. perplexity, being a newer model, is not as computationally sound as some of the older models (e.g. ChatGPT), but that doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean it\u0026rsquo;s bad. Finally both of Google\u0026rsquo;s models are of similar quality, they point to a wide range of industries, unlike the other models that are very specific, but it explains the reasoning clearly and creatively.\n","permalink":"https://jask.cc/en/posts/research/multi-aimodel-discuss/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"tldr\"\u003eTL;DR\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor now, many company develop their own AI-Model.

Report Overview 2024 was a year of rapid growth and adjustment in the blockchain industry, with the financing market evolving in response to technological innovations, market price volatility, and changes in the macroeconomic environment. Bitcoin and ethereum reached all-time highs in March 2024, followed by dramatic market volatility. Against this backdrop, venture capital (VC) financing activities also exhibit a unique rhythm, demonstrating the lag effect between market sentiment and investment decisions. By analyzing the financing data and quarterly performance of different sectors, it is possible to reveal the investment trends, technological advances, and future development potential of the blockchain industry.\nII. Financing data and project distribution analysis As of September 5, 2024, a total of 395 blockchain financing projects have been disclosed, covering a wide range of segments such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Decentralized Finance (DeFi), Chain Tour (GameFi), Layer1 and Layer2, and so on. Below is the distribution of the total amount of financing and the number of projects in each category:\nCategory Total financing ($ million) Percentage (%) Number AI 39787 13% 51 DeFi 89505 29% 167 Layer1 71648 23% 31 Layer2 54918 17% 46 GameFi 56034 18% 100 III. Trends in quarterly financing and number of projects AI: continuous growth and promising investment prospects AI is the highlight of financing in the blockchain field in 2024, with the financing amount and the number of projects showing a trend of continuous growth. Specifically, the number of investors in the AI field has gradually increased, with the financing amount growing from USD 89.87 million in Q1 to USD 175.1 million in Q3, and the number of projects increasing from 15 to 19. This growth trend reflects the great potential of the deep integration of blockchain and AI technology. the application of AI in decentralized finance, automated smart contracts, and prediction markets has led to the increasing willingness of VCs to invest in this field. It is expected that AI will become a key driver in the blockchain ecosystem in the future and continue to attract a large amount of funds and resources.\nDeFi: highest market share, but slowing growth momentum DeFi projects dominate the blockchain funding market with a 29% share, raising a total of $89.505 million. However, in terms of quarterly trends, the total amount of financing and the number of projects in DeFi peaked in Q1, and then gradually declined.In Q1, the amount of financing was $348.74 million and the number of projects was 59, while in Q3, the amount of financing dropped to $220.30 million and the number of projects decreased to 43.The DeFi market experienced explosive growth from 2020 to 2023, but the 2024 data suggests that VC investors are beginning to evaluate the business models and sustainability of DeFi projects more critically. Nonetheless, DeFi remains one of the most mature application areas of blockchain technology and may attract investment again in the future through technological innovations such as emerging synthetic assets, decentralized insurance, and automated market making.\nGameFi: early boom, Q3 pullback GameFi had a strong start to 2024, with Q1 and Q2 funding totaling $258.17 million and $184.4 million, with 36 and 44 projects, respectively. However, entering Q3, GameFi\u0026rsquo;s market heated up significantly, with financing amounting to only $117.77 million and the number of projects dropping to 20. This change reflects the high volatility of the chain game market. Although chain games have great potential to attract users and funding, challenges to their business model (e.g., low user retention rate, game sustainability issues) also made investors become more cautious in Q3. The future performance of GameFi will depend on its ability to realize stronger user stickiness and innovative game economy system.\nLayer1: funding peak in Q2, sharp drop in Q3 Layer1 project attracted a large amount of funds in Q2, with the financing amount reaching $537.98 million, a significant increase from $166 million in Q1. However, in Q3, funding plummeted to $12.5 million, and the number of projects dropped from 16 in Q2 to 2. The Layer1 project, as the infrastructure of blockchain technology, relies on large-scale technology innovation and ecosystem building. Therefore, the outburst of financing in Q2 may be related to the release of major projects or technological breakthroughs, while the sharp drop in Q3 shows that the market has entered a period of observation and adjustment after significant progress.The high threshold of Layer1 technology makes its financing volatile, but in the long run, it is still the core driving force for the development of the blockchain industry.\nLayer2: Stable Development, Slower Growth Rate The financing amount of Layer2 projects gradually decreased after reaching $351.8 million in Q1, with Q2 and Q3 financing amounting to $128.28 million and $69.1 million respectively. Although the number of projects is relatively stable, the decline in financing scale shows that the market demand for Layer2 scalability solutions is gradually stabilizing.Layer2 solutions are designed to enhance the scalability and transaction efficiency of blockchain, which is one of the key technological directions in the blockchain industry at present. Despite the decrease in financing in the short term, the practicality and importance of Layer2 technology determines that it will continue to be developed in the long term in the future.\nFourth, the relationship between market prices and financing trends The prices of Bitcoin and Ether reached record highs of $73,787.1 and $4,049.66 respectively in Q1 2024, but contrary to the market sentiment, VC financing activities were more conservative in Q1, and only ushered in large-scale investments in Q2. This phenomenon suggests that VCs tend to lag behind market sentiment in their investment decisions, and instead of investing at market highs, they prefer to enter during market pullbacks. The specific analysis is as follows:\nLagging nature of VC investments Bitcoin and ethereum reached all-time highs in Q1, but VCs did not invest heavily during this period, instead raising large amounts of capital in Q2 when market volatility increased. This may be because VCs are more focused on long-term value than short-term market volatility. market volatility in Q2 provided more attractive project valuations, prompting VCs to increase their investments in that quarter.\nImpact of market volatility on funding activity Bitcoin and ethereum prices fluctuated significantly in Q2, from highs of $72,799 and $ 3980 back to lows of $56,555 and $2,791. In this market environment, investors paid more attention to the potential value of projects rather than market sentiment, especially in the Layer1 and GameFi sectors, where there was a large influx of funding, demonstrating VCs\u0026rsquo; confidence in long-term technological breakthroughs and market potential.\nReasons for the decrease in Q3 funding Market sentiment in Q3 was relatively cold, with Bitcoin price falling to $55,798 and Ether price dropping to $2,353. Combined with the funding data, the decrease in funding in Q3 may be due to investors\u0026rsquo; cautious attitude towards short-term market volatility. Project owners received a large amount of funding in Q2, and Q3 may be a phase of project construction and technology advancement, with VCs adopting a wait-and-see attitude, waiting for further progress of these projects.\nV. Future outlook and investment recommendations Q4 Financing Outlook Looking ahead to Q4 2024, financing activities are expected to pick up, especially in AI, Layer1 and Layer2. With the release of more projects\u0026rsquo; technical results and the gradual recovery of market sentiment, VCs may once again increase their investment in blockchain infrastructure and innovative applications. The combination of AI and blockchain is a key focus for future investment, and AI-driven decentralized application scenarios (e.g., automated decision-making for smart contracts, decentralized prediction markets, etc.) will continue to attract a large amount of capital. Layer1 \u0026amp; Layer2 projects will attract more long-term capital as blockchain scalability and performance improve, especially projects that have already secured funding in Q2 may demonstrate technological breakthroughs in Q4, further driving capital inflows. DeFi and GameFi may see a recovery in Q4, especially if DeFi is able to launch innovative products and GameFi is able to solve key issues such as user retention, the market\u0026rsquo;s investment enthusiasm will return. Investment Recommendations For VCs and investors, here are some suggestions for future investment strategies: Focus on projects driven by technological innovation: the core value of blockchain lies in technological innovation, especially in the application scenarios combining the underlying architecture (Layer1 and Layer2) and AI, investors should focus on projects with breakthrough technological capabilities and clear business models. Seize opportunities in market volatility at the right time: Historical data shows that market volatility often provides VCs with opportunities to enter at low prices. Investors can assess the valuation of high-potential projects during market sentiment downturns valuations and obtain higher returns through strategic investments. Diversified portfolio: The blockchain industry has a variety of technology paths, and investors should adopt a diversified investment strategy covering multiple sectors from AI to DeFi, Layer1, Layer2, etc. to diversify risks and capture more market opportunities. VI. Conclusion Financing and market trends in the blockchain industry in 2024 exhibit a combination of technology innovation-driven and volatile market sentiment. Despite the decrease in financing activities in Q3, this is only a short-term adjustment period, and with the acceleration of technological progress in Q4, financing activities are expected to be active again. In the future, innovations in the fields of AI, Layer1 and Layer2 will become the hotspots for capital to chase, and the recovery of DeFi and GameFi is also expected to drive the further development of the industry. The investment behavior of VCs demonstrates long-term confidence in technology, and they are able to seize the opportunities in market fluctuations to realize the\n","permalink":"https://jask.cc/en/posts/research/blockchain-market-research-report-q1-q3-2024/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"blockchain-industry-financing-and-market-dynamics-research-report-2024\"\u003eBlockchain Industry Financing and Market Dynamics Research Report 2024\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"i-report-overview\"\u003eI.
