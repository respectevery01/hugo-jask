I can‚Äôt determine which model is more accurate. Topic is ‚ÄúStudy which burns more calories, running three kilometers fast (average pace 5 min 45 sec/KM) or jogging three kilometers (average pace 7 min/KM)? Now ai era, the hottest is big data + AI and blockchain + AI, the market has appeared a lot of use cases, but when we all know that there is a focus in the line of sight, then there is a blind spot, people are concerned about the artificial intelligence, then, there are those non-artificial intelligence industry is in the next five years is promising?‚Äù\nChatGPT-4o 1. Calorie Burn: Running vs. Jogging Running faster burns more calories than jogging the same distance, even though both activities cover 3 kilometers. Here‚Äôs why:\nRunning (5:45 min/km): At a faster pace, you push your body harder, causing a higher heart rate and greater energy expenditure. Running at 5:45 min/km typically burns about 100-150 calories per kilometer, depending on factors like weight and fitness level. Jogging (7:00 min/km): Jogging is less intense, so while you still burn calories, it tends to be around 80-100 calories per kilometer. Though the difference in time is small, the higher intensity of running means a faster calorie burn overall. On average, running 3 kilometers fast burns more calories than jogging the same distance.\n2. Non-AI Industries with Promising Futures Despite the focus on AI, some non-AI industries are showing promise over the next five years:\nRenewable Energy: As the world shifts toward sustainable solutions, solar, wind, and hydropower are set to expand. Innovations in energy storage, efficiency, and grid management will play a critical role in meeting climate goals. Healthcare \u0026 Biotechnology: With advances in personalized medicine, genomics, and new treatments, the healthcare industry will continue growing, particularly in areas like gene editing (e.g., CRISPR) and wearable health tech. Sustainable Agriculture \u0026 Food Tech: As populations grow and climate change impacts food production, there is increasing demand for sustainable farming, vertical agriculture, plant-based proteins, and lab-grown meat. Circular Economy \u0026 Recycling Tech: Reducing waste and managing resources better are global priorities. Industries focusing on recycling, upcycling, and materials science will thrive, particularly as consumers demand greener products. Logistics \u0026 Supply Chain Innovation: Innovations in logistics‚Äîlike drone deliveries, autonomous vehicles, and blockchain for transparent supply chains‚Äîare growing rapidly, especially post-pandemic. Blockchain is increasingly utilized to verify product origins and track global shipments. These industries may benefit from some AI integration, but their core growth is driven by factors beyond AI.\nAccording to the GPT, fast running burns more calories than jogging, and it points to a promising future for logistics and supply chains.\nClaude-3.5 Sonnet Let‚Äôs break this down into two parts:\nCalorie burn comparison: Running 3 km fast (5:45 min/km pace) will generally burn more calories than jogging 3 km at a slower pace (7:00 min/km). This is because:\nHigher intensity exercise typically burns more calories per minute The faster pace requires more effort and engages more muscle fibers The body works harder to maintain the quicker speed However, the exact calorie difference depends on factors like the individual‚Äôs weight, fitness level, and metabolism. On average, a 70 kg (154 lb) person might burn:\nAbout 270-300 calories running 3 km at the faster pace About 230-250 calories jogging 3 km at the slower pace Promising non-AI industries in the next five years: While AI and blockchain are indeed hot topics, several non-AI industries show promise:\na) Renewable Energy: With climate change concerns growing, solar, wind, and other clean energy technologies are likely to see significant growth.\nb) Biotechnology and Personalized Medicine: Advancements in gene therapy, personalized treatments, and drug discovery offer huge potential.\nc) Space Technology: Private space exploration, satellite internet, and space tourism are emerging fields with room for growth.\nd) Sustainable Agriculture: Vertical farming, precision agriculture, and plant-based proteins are addressing food security and environmental concerns.\ne) Mental Health Services: The growing awareness of mental health issues is driving demand for innovative treatment and support services.\nf) Cybersecurity: As digital threats evolve, the need for advanced security solutions continues to grow.\ng) Elderly Care and Age-Tech: With aging populations in many countries, services and technologies for older adults are becoming increasingly important.\nh) Circular Economy and Recycling: Industries focused on reducing waste and promoting sustainability are likely to see increased interest and investment.\nThese industries may not be as hyped as AI, but they address critical global challenges and have significant growth potential. Would you like me to elaborate on any of these areas?\nAccording to Claude‚Äôs conclusion, fast running burns more calories than jogging, but it points to areas not mentioned by the GPT: Elderly Care and Age-Tech, Mental Health Services and Space Technology\nPerplexity Pro To compare the calories burned while running and jogging three kilometers, we can analyze the two scenarios based on their respective paces.\nCalories Burned Comparison Running at 5 minutes 45 seconds per kilometer:\nCalories burned: Approximately 232 calories for a person weighing around 159 pounds (72 kg) over a distance of 3 km[1]. Jogging at 7 minutes per kilometer:\nCalories burned: Approximately 243 calories for the same weight over the same distance[2]. Summary of Findings Activity Pace (min/km) Calories Burned Running 5:45 232 Jogging 7:00 243 Conclusion Interestingly, jogging at a slower pace (7 min/km) results in slightly higher calorie expenditure compared to running faster (5:45 min/km). This could be attributed to the longer duration of the activity, as calorie burn is influenced by both intensity and time spent exercising.\nFuture Prospects Beyond AI In terms of industries that may show promise in the next five years outside of artificial intelligence, several sectors are gaining attention:\nRenewable Energy: As global awareness of climate change increases, investments in solar, wind, and other renewable energy sources are expected to grow significantly.\nHealthcare Technology: Innovations in telemedicine, wearable health devices, and personalized medicine are transforming healthcare delivery and patient management.\nCybersecurity: With the rise in digital transformations and data breaches, demand for robust cybersecurity solutions is increasing.\nSustainable Agriculture: Technologies aimed at improving food production efficiency while minimizing environmental impact are becoming crucial.\nBlockchain Applications: Beyond cryptocurrencies, blockchain technology is being explored for supply chain transparency, secure transactions, and digital identity verification.\nThese sectors highlight a shift towards sustainability and efficiency, indicating strong growth potential in the coming years.\nCitations: [1] https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?input=Calories+burned+running+3+kilometers+at+5+minutes+45+seconds+per+kilometer [2] https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?input=Calories+burned+jogging+3+kilometers+at+7+minutes+per+kilometer\nAccording to Perplexity, jogging burns more calories than fast running. This conclusion is different from the one reached by the two models above, and it also points to blockchain as a promising industry for the next five years\nKimi ai Chinese prompt VS Kimi ai English prompt Chinese prompt: Á†îÁ©∂‰∏Ä‰∏ãÂø´Ë∑ë‰∏âÂÖ¨ÈáåÔºàÂπ≥ÂùáÈÖçÈÄü5ÂàÜ45Áßí/KMÔºâÂíåÊÖ¢Ë∑ë‰∏âÂÖ¨ÈáåÔºàÂπ≥ÂùáÈÖçÈÄü7ÂàÜÈíü/KMÔºâÂì™‰∏™Ê∂àËÄóÁöÑÁÉ≠ÈáèÂ§ßÔºüÁé∞Âú®aiÊó∂‰ª£ÔºåÊúÄÁÅ´ÁÉ≠ÁöÑÂ∞±ÊòØÂ§ßÊï∞ÊçÆ+AIÂíåÂå∫ÂùóÈìæ+AIÔºåÂ∏ÇÈù¢‰∏äÂ∑≤ÁªèÂá∫Áé∞‰∫ÜÂæàÂ§öÁî®‰æãÔºå‰ΩÜÊòØÂΩìÊàë‰ª¨ÈÉΩÁü•ÈÅìËßÜÁ∫ø‰∏≠Êúâ‰∫ÜÁÑ¶ÁÇπÔºåÈÇ£‰æøÊúâ‰∫ÜÁõ≤ÁÇπÔºå‰∫∫‰ª¨ÈÉΩÂÖ≥Ê≥®‰∫∫Â∑•Êô∫ËÉΩÁöÑËØùÔºåËøòÊúâÈÇ£‰∫õÈùû‰∫∫Â∑•Êô∫ËÉΩË°å‰∏öÊòØÂú®Êú™Êù•‰∫îÂπ¥ÂÜÖÊòØÊúâÂâçÊôØÁöÑÔºü\nEnglish prompt: Study which burns more calories, running three kilometers fast (average pace 5 min 45 sec/KM) or jogging three kilometers (average pace 7 min/KM)?

But the industry it points out is hardly different from the previous one. This shows that the English version is a bit more accurate than the Chinese version.\nGemini 1.5 Pro VS Gamma 2 2B Both models are developed by Google, but only Gemini is open for user use\n1. Gemini 1.5 Pro Running at a faster pace (5 min 45 sec/KM) will burn more calories than jogging (7 min/KM) for the same distance of three kilometers. This is because higher intensity exercise requires more energy expenditure. While the total distance is the same, the faster pace means more work is done in a shorter time, leading to a higher calorie burn.\nRegarding your question about promising non-AI industries in the next five years, it‚Äôs important to remember that AI is becoming pervasive, influencing many sectors. However, several areas are likely to thrive independently or alongside AI:\nRenewable Energy: With growing climate concerns, the renewable energy sector, including solar, wind, geothermal, and hydrogen power, is poised for significant growth. Jobs in installation, maintenance, and research will be in demand. Healthcare (specifically non-AI driven aspects): While AI is transforming diagnostics and drug discovery, core healthcare professions like nursing, physical therapy, and elder care will remain crucial due to aging populations and the increasing demand for personalized care. Mental health services are also expected to see continued growth. Sustainable Agriculture and Food Production: As the global population grows, sustainable farming practices, food technology focused on reducing waste and improving yields, and alternative protein sources will become increasingly important. Skilled Trades: Plumbers, electricians, carpenters, and HVAC technicians will continue to be in high demand as infrastructure ages and requires maintenance and upgrades. These are areas where automation is more challenging. Personalized Education and Training: While AI can play a role in education, the need for human interaction and individualized learning experiences will remain strong. This includes areas like specialized tutoring, vocational training, and life coaching. Creative Industries: While AI can generate art and music, the uniquely human aspects of creativity, storytelling, and emotional expression will continue to be valued. This includes fields like writing, performing arts, visual arts, and design. Cybersecurity: As our reliance on technology increases, so does the risk of cyberattacks. Experts in cybersecurity will be essential for protecting individuals, businesses, and governments from these threats. While AI can assist, human expertise is paramount. Biotechnology (outside of AI-driven drug discovery): Fields like genetic counseling, biomanufacturing, and bioethics will see growth, driven by advancements in understanding and manipulating biological systems. It‚Äôs important to note that these are just a few examples, and the specific industries that thrive will depend on various factors, including technological advancements, economic conditions, and societal changes. Also, keep in mind that even in these ‚Äúnon-AI‚Äù industries, AI will likely play some role, even if it‚Äôs not the primary driver. The key is to look for areas where uniquely human skills and expertise remain essential.\nAccording to 1.5 Pro, fast running burns more calories than jogging, and it points to a completely different industry than the other models - Skilled Trades - which is interesting, and in layman‚Äôs terms means that blue-collar will be a high-paying profession in the future!\n2. Gamma 2 2B Let‚Äôs break down your questions:\nBurning Calories\nFast Running: Running at an average pace of 5:45/km for 3 km would burn significantly more calories than jogging. This is because fast running requires a higher intensity and your body works harder to maintain that speed. Jogging: Jogging at 7 min/km for 3 km will burn fewer calories than fast running. Why the Difference?\nIntensity: Fast running is much more intense than jogging. Your heart rate and breathing will be elevated, and your muscles will be working harder. Metabolic Rate: Your body burns more calories at a higher intensity. Important Note: The exact number of calories burned depends on factors like your weight, age, and fitness level.\nAI and Non-AI Industries in the Next 5 Years\nYou‚Äôre right, the hype around AI is immense, but it‚Äôs important to remember that AI is just one tool in the toolbox. Here are some industries that are likely to see significant growth in the next 5 years, regardless of AI:\nHealthcare: Telemedicine, personalized medicine, and preventative care will continue to grow. Manufacturing: Automation and robotics will continue to reshape the manufacturing landscape. Renewable Energy: Solar, wind, and other renewable energy sources will see continued investment and development. Agriculture: Precision agriculture, using data and AI, will improve efficiency and sustainability. Education: Online learning platforms and personalized learning experiences will become more prevalent. Financial Services: Fintech (financial technology) will continue to evolve, with AI playing a key role in areas like fraud detection and investment management. The Importance of Balance\nWhile AI is a powerful tool, it‚Äôs important to remember that it‚Äôs not a magic bullet. Many industries will continue to thrive because of human ingenuity, creativity, and the ability to adapt to change.\nLet me know if you‚Äôd like to explore any of these industries in more detail!\nAccording to Gamma‚Äôs conclusions, fast running burns more calories than jogging, and it points out that financial services are promising, unlike all the previous models\nAll in All Finally, even though I listed many of the AI models on the market, it‚Äôs still not all of them. They all have their own focus; Kimi‚Äôs English version is better than the Chinese version, but since it can only search websites within China, the accuracy is not as good as the other models. ChatGPT and Claude are both comparable. perplexity, being a newer model, is not as computationally sound as some of the older models (e.g. ChatGPT), but that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs bad. Finally both of Google‚Äôs models are of similar quality, they point to a wide range of industries, unlike the other models that are very specific, but it explains the reasoning clearly and creatively.\n",

<p>For now, many company develop their own AI-Model. But they all vary in quality, and I collected answers from different AI models on the same topic. I can&rsquo;t determine which model is more accurate. Topic is &ldquo;Study which burns more calories, running three kilometers fast (average pace 5 min 45 sec/KM) or jogging three kilometers (average pace 7 min/KM)? Now ai era, the hottest is big data + AI and blockchain + AI, the market has appeared a lot of use cases, but when we all know that there is a focus in the line of sight, then there is a blind spot, people are concerned about the artificial intelligence, then, there are those non-artificial intelligence industry is in the next five years is promising?&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="1-calorie-burn-running-vs-jogging">1. Calorie Burn: Running vs. Jogging<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#1-calorie-burn-running-vs-jogging">#</a></h3>
<p>Running faster burns more calories than jogging the same distance, even though both activities cover 3 kilometers. Here&rsquo;s why:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Running (5:45 min/km):</strong> At a faster pace, you push your body harder, causing a higher heart rate and greater energy expenditure. Running at 5:45 min/km typically burns about 100-150 calories per kilometer, depending on factors like weight and fitness level.</li>
<li><strong>Jogging (7:00 min/km):</strong> Jogging is less intense, so while you still burn calories, it tends to be around 80-100 calories per kilometer. Though the difference in time is small, the higher intensity of running means a faster calorie burn overall.</li>
</ul>
<p>On average, <strong>running 3 kilometers fast burns more calories than jogging the same distance</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="2-non-ai-industries-with-promising-futures">2. Non-AI Industries with Promising Futures<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#2-non-ai-industries-with-promising-futures">#</a></h3>
<p>Despite the focus on AI, some non-AI industries are showing promise over the next five years:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Renewable Energy:</strong> As the world shifts toward sustainable solutions, solar, wind, and hydropower are set to expand. Innovations in energy storage, efficiency, and grid management will play a critical role in meeting climate goals.</li>
<li><strong>Healthcare &amp; Biotechnology:</strong> With advances in personalized medicine, genomics, and new treatments, the healthcare industry will continue growing, particularly in areas like gene editing (e.g., CRISPR) and wearable health tech.</li>
<li><strong>Sustainable Agriculture &amp; Food Tech:</strong> As populations grow and climate change impacts food production, there is increasing demand for sustainable farming, vertical agriculture, plant-based proteins, and lab-grown meat.</li>
<li><strong>Circular Economy &amp; Recycling Tech:</strong> Reducing waste and managing resources better are global priorities. Industries focusing on recycling, upcycling, and materials science will thrive, particularly as consumers demand greener products.</li>
<li><strong>Logistics &amp; Supply Chain Innovation:</strong> Innovations in logistics‚Äîlike drone deliveries, autonomous vehicles, and blockchain for transparent supply chains‚Äîare growing rapidly, especially post-pandemic. Blockchain is increasingly utilized to verify product origins and track global shipments.</li>
</ol>
<p>These industries may benefit from some AI integration, but their core growth is driven by factors beyond AI.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Let&rsquo;s break this down into two parts:</p>
<ol>
<li>Calorie burn comparison:</li>
</ol>
<p>Running 3 km fast (5:45 min/km pace) will generally burn more calories than jogging 3 km at a slower pace (7:00 min/km). This is because:</p>
<ul>
<li>Higher intensity exercise typically burns more calories per minute</li>
<li>The faster pace requires more effort and engages more muscle fibers</li>
<li>The body works harder to maintain the quicker speed</li>
</ul>
<p>However, the exact calorie difference depends on factors like the individual&rsquo;s weight, fitness level, and metabolism. On average, a 70 kg (154 lb) person might burn:</p>
<ul>
<li>About 270-300 calories running 3 km at the faster pace</li>
<li>About 230-250 calories jogging 3 km at the slower pace</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>Promising non-AI industries in the next five years:</li>
</ol>
<p>While AI and blockchain are indeed hot topics, several non-AI industries show promise:</p>
<p>a) Renewable Energy: With climate change concerns growing, solar, wind, and other clean energy technologies are likely to see significant growth.</p>
<p>b) Biotechnology and Personalized Medicine: Advancements in gene therapy, personalized treatments, and drug discovery offer huge potential.</p>
<p>c) Space Technology: Private space exploration, satellite internet, and space tourism are emerging fields with room for growth.</p>
<p>d) Sustainable Agriculture: Vertical farming, precision agriculture, and plant-based proteins are addressing food security and environmental concerns.</p>
<p>e) Mental Health Services: The growing awareness of mental health issues is driving demand for innovative treatment and support services.</p>
<p>f) Cybersecurity: As digital threats evolve, the need for advanced security solutions continues to grow.</p>
<p>g) Elderly Care and Age-Tech: With aging populations in many countries, services and technologies for older adults are becoming increasingly important.</p>
<p>h) Circular Economy and Recycling: Industries focused on reducing waste and promoting sustainability are likely to see increased interest and investment.</p>
<p>These industries may not be as hyped as AI, but they address critical global challenges and have significant growth potential. Would you like me to elaborate on any of these areas?</p>

<p><strong>It&rsquo;s interesting to note that the English version&rsquo;s conclusion is completely different from the previous Chinese version, which concluded that fast running burns more calories than jogging. But the industry it points out is hardly different from the previous one. This shows that the English version is a bit more accurate than the Chinese version.</strong></p>

<p>Both models are developed by Google, but only Gemini is open for user use</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Running at a faster pace (5 min 45 sec/KM) will burn more calories than jogging (7 min/KM) for the same distance of three kilometers.  This is because higher intensity exercise requires more energy expenditure.  While the total distance is the same, the faster pace means more work is done in a shorter time, leading to a higher calorie burn.</p>
<p>Regarding your question about promising non-AI industries in the next five years, it&rsquo;s important to remember that AI is becoming pervasive, influencing many sectors.  However, several areas are likely to thrive independently or alongside AI:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Renewable Energy:</strong>  With growing climate concerns, the renewable energy sector, including solar, wind, geothermal, and hydrogen power, is poised for significant growth. Jobs in installation, maintenance, and research will be in demand.</li>
<li><strong>Healthcare (specifically non-AI driven aspects):</strong> While AI is transforming diagnostics and drug discovery, core healthcare professions like nursing, physical therapy, and elder care will remain crucial due to aging populations and the increasing demand for personalized care.  Mental health services are also expected to see continued growth.</li>
<li><strong>Sustainable Agriculture and Food Production:</strong>  As the global population grows, sustainable farming practices, food technology focused on reducing waste and improving yields, and alternative protein sources will become increasingly important.</li>
<li><strong>Skilled Trades:</strong>  Plumbers, electricians, carpenters, and HVAC technicians will continue to be in high demand as infrastructure ages and requires maintenance and upgrades.  These are areas where automation is more challenging.</li>
<li><strong>Personalized Education and Training:</strong>  While AI can play a role in education, the need for human interaction and individualized learning experiences will remain strong. This includes areas like specialized tutoring, vocational training, and life coaching.</li>
<li><strong>Creative Industries:</strong> While AI can generate art and music, the uniquely human aspects of creativity, storytelling, and emotional expression will continue to be valued.  This includes fields like writing, performing arts, visual arts, and design.</li>
<li><strong>Cybersecurity:</strong> As our reliance on technology increases, so does the risk of cyberattacks.  Experts in cybersecurity will be essential for protecting individuals, businesses, and governments from these threats.  While AI can assist, human expertise is paramount.</li>
<li><strong>Biotechnology (outside of AI-driven drug discovery):</strong>  Fields like genetic counseling, biomanufacturing, and bioethics will see growth, driven by advancements in understanding and manipulating biological systems.</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to note that these are just a few examples, and the specific industries that thrive will depend on various factors, including technological advancements, economic conditions, and societal changes.  Also, keep in mind that even in these &ldquo;non-AI&rdquo; industries, AI will likely play <em>some</em> role, even if it&rsquo;s not the primary driver.  The key is to look for areas where uniquely human skills and expertise remain essential.</p>

<p><strong>According to 1.5 Pro, fast running burns more calories than jogging, and it points to a completely different industry than the other models - Skilled Trades - which is interesting, and in layman&rsquo;s terms means that blue-collar will be a high-paying profession in the future!</strong></p>
<h3 id="2-gamma-2-2b">2. Gamma 2 2B<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#2-gamma-2-2b">#</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Let&rsquo;s break down your questions:</p>
<p><strong>Burning Calories</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fast Running:</strong>  Running at an average pace of 5:45/km for 3 km would burn significantly more calories than jogging. This is because fast running requires a higher intensity and your body works harder to maintain that speed.</li>
<li><strong>Jogging:</strong> Jogging at 7 min/km for 3 km will burn fewer calories than fast running.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why the Difference?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intensity:</strong>  Fast running is much more intense than jogging. Your heart rate and breathing will be elevated, and your muscles will be working harder.</li>
<li><strong>Metabolic Rate:</strong>  Your body burns more calories at a higher intensity.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong>  The exact number of calories burned depends on factors like your weight, age, and fitness level.</p>
<p><strong>AI and Non-AI Industries in the Next 5 Years</strong></p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right, the hype around AI is immense, but it&rsquo;s important to remember that AI is just one tool in the toolbox.  Here are some industries that are likely to see significant growth in the next 5 years, regardless of AI:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Healthcare:</strong>  Telemedicine, personalized medicine, and preventative care will continue to grow.</li>
<li><strong>Manufacturing:</strong>  Automation and robotics will continue to reshape the manufacturing landscape.</li>
<li><strong>Renewable Energy:</strong>  Solar, wind, and other renewable energy sources will see continued investment and development.</li>
<li><strong>Agriculture:</strong>  Precision agriculture, using data and AI, will improve efficiency and sustainability.</li>
<li><strong>Education:</strong>  Online learning platforms and personalized learning experiences will become more prevalent.</li>
<li><strong>Financial Services:</strong>  Fintech (financial technology) will continue to evolve, with AI playing a key role in areas like fraud detection and investment management.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Importance of Balance</strong></p>
<p>While AI is a powerful tool, it&rsquo;s important to remember that it&rsquo;s not a magic bullet.  Many industries will continue to thrive because of human ingenuity, creativity, and the ability to adapt to change.</p>
<p>Let me know if you&rsquo;d like to explore any of these industries in more detail!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>According to Gamma&rsquo;s conclusions, fast running burns more calories than jogging, and it points out that financial services are promising, unlike all the previous models</strong></p>
<h1 id="all-in-all">All in All<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#all-in-all">#</a></h1>
<p>Finally, even though I listed many of the AI models on the market, it&rsquo;s still not all of them. They all have their own focus; Kimi&rsquo;s English version is better than the Chinese version, but since it can only search websites within China, the accuracy is not as good as the other models. ChatGPT and Claude are both comparable. perplexity, being a newer model, is not as computationally sound as some of the older models (e.g. ChatGPT), but that doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s bad. Finally both of Google&rsquo;s models are of similar quality, they point to a wide range of industries, unlike the other models that are very specific, but it explains the reasoning clearly and creatively.</p>
